memory-errors
=============

These scripts are part of our *[Memory Errors: The Past, the Present, and the
Future](http://vvdveen.com/publications/RAID2012.pdf)* paper, published at RAID
in 2012. Running the plotscripter.py script should download and parse the CVE
and exploit-db databases and create a number of plots (generated with gnuplot,
make sure to apt-get install gnuplot-x11). You can view them and their
description by opening the webpage.html file.
